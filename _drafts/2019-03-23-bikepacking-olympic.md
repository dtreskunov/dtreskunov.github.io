A bikepacking trip on Washington's Olympic Peninsula

To try out this bikepacking thing, I chose the [Cross Washington Mountain Bike Route](http://www.bikepacking.com/routes/cross-washington-xwa/), which covers the entire state from the Pacific to the Montana border. I had three days to work with, and my goal was to follow the route from Seattle all the way to the Pacific. I was to cover the 220 miles in two days, sleep on the beach, and on the third day I was planning to catch a ride on the county bus back to [Port Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Angeles,_Washington), and maybe, depending on how I felt, ride out on my own power.

I had done long rides before, most recently the RAMBOD (Ride Around Mount Baker in One Day), put on by [Bellingham Grind Corps](https://bellinghamgrindcorps.com/), a group that promotes unofficial, "all-surface cycling sufferfests in and around Bellingham, WA." So my plan wasn't entirely outrageous, or so I thought.

Day 1
=====

The ride to [Quilcene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quilcene,_Washington) went really well. Big thanks to whoever planned this route, as it avoided all major roads, and the singletrack sections were fun and non-technical, just what you want when riding a 50-pound beast of a bike. The gearing was low enough that riding up hills seemed easier than on an unloaded road bike - just sit back, relax, and enjoy the spinning.

This bikepacking thing wasn't a big deal, or so I thought.

After grinding out the tedious climb on fire road, I dropped in to the [Lower Big Quilcene](https://www.trailforks.com/trails/lower-big-quilcene/) trail, and was rewarded by fast flowy singletrack that initially was going downhill to meet the river. Patches of snow started appearing, growing larger as I approached the stream, and eventually merging to cover the entire trail. Slipping and sliding, getting stuck in deep patches, climbing over a bunch of fallen trees: this trip was turning into a real adventure.

I assumed that the worst of the snow would be on the singletrack, and that once I come out of the trail on the other side and onto fire road, it would have melted. Well, that was just silly. The fire road was covered by soft, ankle deep snow. Even the fat, 3 inch wide tires could not cope.

At that point, it was after sun down, and the light was really fading. The place had a really remote feel to it: I could see no tracks on the snow. My feet were soaked through, and morale was low, made lower when I realized I left my alternate pair of socks at home.

I had to face reality. Was it time to turn back? According to my maps, the route continued uphill into the 3000 foot range, and it would be around 30 miles until it emerged from the wilderness. I was 20 miles from Dungeness Forks Campground, which is where I was planning to sleep. Pushing uphill, through the snow, in the dark, for 20 miles was out of the question.

I rode a short ways up the road and found a snow-free stretch of gravel. This was encouraging, and gave hope for tomorrow. The tent was pitched, dinner consumed. Proper hydration achieved by downing a tall can of beer (made in Colorado with mountain spring water, it said on the can!). The stars were out, and I wondered what the two shiny dots following each other about two finger-widths apart could be. Satellites through space in formation?

Day 2
=====

Inside the tent, zipped up for the night, it was difficult to fall asleep with cold feet. In addition, my hamstrings started cramping something fierce when I turned awkwardly inside the sleeping bag. Eventually, the beer started working and I drifted off, lulled into slumber by the sound of Big Quilcene River rushing by in the gully far below, but not before realizing there was another stream nearby. I was overjoyed when I woke up in the middle of the night - due to the quantity of beer consumed - and realized that my socks were completely dry, and my feet were warm. Little joys of life.

In the morning, I filtered three liters of water from the small stream, took down the tent while waiting for the water to boil in order to make coffee, and assessed the situation. I told myself that I would continue on my planned route for two hours, and if the snow situation was making me totally miserable, I would turn around at that point. The ride started on an good note with a smooth, fast descent, which turned into a smooth, slow climb. The road would slope downhill, there would be a turn at the bottom over a bridge or a drainage pipe, then the road would climb back up. Snow was covering sections or road close to flowing water; otherwise, the road was bare. Eventually, I was near the high point above 3000 feet and the snow cover was constant. It was a lot of fun to ride downhill on top of the crusty snow, but as I descended, the crust thinned out, and could no longer support the weight. Soon the bike started periodically punching through the crust and sinking into the slush below. I was pushing uphill, in the snow, both ways.

Two hours went by, and I wasn't miserable, despite averaging only 5 miles an hour and getting my feet wet again. Soon I hit on some snowmobile tracks in the snow, some car tracks, and even mountain bike tracks. I kept myself motivated by thinking of reaching the campground and drinking some delicious coffee made with mountain stream water. Soon the dream turned into reality. And soon after leaving the (empty) campground, the route led me to paved roads and what felt like warp-speed descent into [Sequim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequim,_Washington).

However, all was not rainbows and unicorns. Covered in grit due to riding through slush and mud, my chain was making a terrible racket, and eventually got stuck on the front chainring and jammed against the bottom of the chainstay. I thought back to when I was checking things off my packing list the night before the trip, and leaving "chain brush" and "chain lube" uncrossed. The little bottle of chain lube was nowhere to be found, and I thought I would be fine for three days. Or until the first bike shop I came across. Oh well.

After getting help at the closest (thankfully, only a small detour) bike shop, I continued westward on the paved Olympic Discovery Trail, which passed between bucolic farms in the lowlands below the foothills. It was flat and it was fast. The chain, properly cleaned and taken care of, was now running totally silent. Until the noise started again. Upon close inspection, I found a broken link, which was barely holding the chain together. All the dirt and grit must have really taken a toll on it. Again, I thought back to my packing list and congratulated myself for buying a chain tool a day before leaving on my trip. Aftter taking out a pair of links including the broken one, I was left with a chain that was almost too short (for the slowest gear). It could tolerate no more breaks!

Unfortunately, my repair didn't hold and the chain separated when I tried to crank up a small hill. I suspected that reusing chain pins was not well advised, and remembered how when my chain tool pushed the pin out, a tiny shaving of metal got separated from it. At this point, I was too far from the bike shop to make it back before closing time, stranded with a broken bike. It was after sunset and the light was fading. It was time to call it a day.

After putting the chain back together as best I could, I gingerly made my way to the closest plot of land with good tree cover that was marked as a public park on the map. There, I found a spot furthest from any trails and set up an illegal camp under the cover of darkness. Dinner was delicious: re-hydrated spicy sausage pasta, acquired on sale at REI for $5.93.

Day 3
=====

Inside the tent, I remembered suddenly that the previous owner of the bike had taped a spare chain quicklink to the saddle. I could use it to replace the chain pin that was now compromised. I quickly fell asleep after coming up with this repair plan. Unfortunately, in the morning, upon unwrapping the electrical tape, I only found half of the quicklink! How could so many things go wrong at once? However, I found that the pin wasn't centered properly (it was pushed too far to one side). An easy fix with a chain tool. Time would tell if the chain would hold up. And hold up it did! I reached Port Angeles and had a big breakfast while waiting for the bike shop to open. There, I acquired two spare quicklinks, and continued onward to Lake Crescent.

What followed was 20-some miles of smooth singletrack that was fast and easy. Pretty sure it would be rideable on a road bike, but not when loaded up with camping gear! Eventually, I reached my turnaround point at the Eastern terminus of Lake Crescent, marked by a cool tunnel, and a side trail that went over a nice bridge, which looked perfect for diving off into the lake when the weather is warmer.

Objective complete, it was time to figure out whether I was up to the task of riding 120-some miles back home. Opting to skip the singletrack on the way back, I chose the most direct route and was taking it easy, afraid of aggravating some knee soreness that was beginning to set in. The task of riding a total of 150 miles in a day was daunting. This was rapidly turning into a sufferfest worthy of the Grind Corps, aided by the steady drizzle and the fading light.

However, there was no heroics and no suffering that day. By happenstance, I got to Port Angeles just in time to catch the Strait Shot (operated by [Clallam Transit](http://clallamtransit.com/Routes-Schedules) which for $10 whisked me back to the Seattle ferry in under two hours. Not a bad deal!
