First order of business upon landing in a foreign city is to sample the local beer.

After checking in to [the hotel](https://www.hotel-monaco.de/), I decided to launch a full frontal assault
on my jetlag and to go out. Following advice from [Spotted by Locals](http://www.spottedbylocals.com/) app,
I went a little outside the main ritzy area of the city and into
[Lindwurmstüberl](http://lindwurmstueberl-muenchen.de), which bills itself as a "Classic Bavarian restaurant
focused on chicken & pork dishes, with Augustiner beer & a roof terrace."

A [Hendl](http://www.munichbeergardens.com/Hendl) and a half-liter of Augustiner later, I was ready to fall asleep.
Jet-lagged and filled with heavy food, it was not easy to go out, but go out I did.

Street musicians in Münich rock! At 11pm on a Sunday, at Marienplatz, a guitar band was playing a catchy
tune and having a contagiously awesome time doing it. 

> Chorus:
>
> She was insane in the brain /
> ... /
> She took the midnight train /
> Through the purple rain

Who can translate what they're singing? And what does the second English line in the chorus say??

Meanwhile, not 50 meters away, a classical quartet was doing their interpretation of Vivaldi's Four Seasons.
The guy on the cimbalom was a virtuoso, you really need to watch him play!

Found this awesome display window of a shop called [Das Spanische Fruchthaus](http://www.spanisches-fruchthaus.de/).

Little did I know, there were more hidden treasures to be discovered by this hapless tourist.
