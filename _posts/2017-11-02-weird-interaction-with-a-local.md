What the hell just happened??

Germans aren't the law-abiding sticklers they are stereotyped as. For example, they jaywalk when it makes sense, not egregiously. On the other hand, some people are taking things (and themselves) quite seriously indeed. I was walking in a very touristy part of München. Think Times Square. After taking a panorama of an awesome little square, I hear some guy calling out to me:

> --- Excuse me!  
> --- *Yes?*  
> --- In Germany, we have a law that says you cannot take pictures of people.  
> --- ‎*Really?*  
> --- ‎Yes, not unless you have their consent. This means you have to ask all of these people if they agree to be in your photos.  
> The guy waves at the crowd of people coming and going around us.  
> --- ‎*Oh*  
> --- ‎You must show me your phone and delete the last picture that has me in it.  
> --- ‎*I'm sorry, I didn't know about such a law. Thank you for telling me. Does this mean that taking pictures in public places is **verboten**? That sounds insane! Do you talk to all these other tourists?*  
> *I wave at the throngs surrounding us*.  
> --- ‎Yes, when I notice them taking pictures with my face in them. I will call the **Polizei** if you don't show to me that my photo is removed from your phone. And don't take such pictures again or you can get in trouble!  
> --- ‎*OK, fine. **Auf wiedersehen!***  

The dude was quite agitated throughout our brief conversation and talking quite loudly. And he was dressed stylishly and nicely (not a гопник by any means). So weird.

Wish I had a picture of the guy to show you, but a gargoyle will do instead.
