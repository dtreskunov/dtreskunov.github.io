> When I look into your eyes  
> I can see a love restrained  
> But darlin' when I hold you  
> Don't you know I feel the same  
> 
> Nothin' lasts forever  
> And we both know hearts can change  
> And it's hard to hold a candle  
> In the cold November rain  
> 
> We've been through this such a long long time  
> Just tryin' to kill the pain, oo yeah  
> But love is always coming and love is always going  
> And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today  
> Walking away  
> 
> If we could take the time  
> To lay it on the line  
> I could rest my head  
> Just knowin' that you were mine  
> All mine  
> So if you want to love me  
> Then darlin' don't refrain  
> Or I'll just end up walkin'  
> In the cold November rain  
> 
> Do you need some time on your own  
> Do you need some time all alone  
> Everybody needs some time  
> On their own  
> Don't you know you need some time all alone  
> 
> I know it's hard to keep an open heart  
> When even friends seem out to harm you  
> But if you could heal a broken heart  
> Wouldn't time be out to charm you  
> 
> Sometimes I need some time on my  
> Own  
> Sometimes I need some time all alone  
> Everybody needs some time  
> On their own  
> Don't you know you need some time all alone  
> 
> And when your fears subside  
> And shadows still remain, oh yeah  
> I know that you can love me  
> When there's no one left to blame  
> So never mind the darkness  
> We still can find a way  
> 'Cause nothin' lasts forever  
> Even cold November rain  
> 
> Don't ya think that you need somebody  
> Don't ya think that you need someone  
> Everybody needs somebody  
> You're not the only one  
> You're not the only one  
> 
> Don't ya think that you need somebody  
> Don't ya think that you need someone  
> Everybody needs somebody  
> You're not the only one
