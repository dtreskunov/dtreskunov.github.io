Here are some photos of my cat.

His full name is Boniface (Бонифаций in Russian). He is named after the cat I grew up with,
a purebred [Russian Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Blue) who had fathered many an offspring and lived to the grand
old age of 18. I hope that his namesake also lives to be an octodecimarian.

The name comes from the Soviet cartoon ["Каникулы Бонифация"](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Каникулы_Бонифация), which features a circus lion who decides to go on vacation to Africa.
